        This endpoint returns notification tasks in the work queue for the given
        FIWARE service and service path. Optionally, it is possible to specify
        task status and/or a FIWARE correlation ID to reduce scope further, so
        that only tasks in the given status and/or having that ID are
        considered. Each returned task object includes the original NGSI entity
        payload that was submitted to the notify endpoint as well as task
        runtime information: task ID, status, any errors occurred while
        executing the task and how many retries are left if retries were
        configured.
      display-name: Retrieve notification tasks offloaded to the work queue.
